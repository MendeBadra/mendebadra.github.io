    "I thought blogging could be a very beneficial thing for me. I have many thoughts, many inspirations and most of them seems to go away without much result. For coding, I like programming language called Julia, but Python is a must in recent times. I mainly have this weird thoughts going on in my head that which language to use in particular projects. And recently, as I tried to find scholarships for my master's studies (which I am still not sure about...), I needed to write an essay (personal statement) and I spend like 3 days to write 5 paragraphs and then polished it using ChatGPT. So, I want to improve my writing skills in general. Funnily enough, I got 7.0 in the writing section of the IELTS test, which is a test that has specific format to remember. I don't write IELTS like essays most of the time so, I kinda forgot them.\n",
