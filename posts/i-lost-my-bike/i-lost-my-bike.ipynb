    "<!-- I lost my f\\*king bike. I just lost it. I should’ve never got lazy and left my bike outside. F*ck. It was a thing that genuinely gave me a joy. “You only gonna love her when you let her go” said somebody. I get it now. To this thief, you just stole my most precious thing. It was a modest bike with not much glamour. But it had a value. It was the mode of transport that I enjoyed dearly. I had never had nice toys, good phones etc. But I was exposed to such items from young age because I went to kind of an rich people kids’ school. I don’t have anything against them but truth of the matter was I kinda was poor. During COVID, I truly come to this fact. But I expected to things turn better perhaps too soon. I was still the guy with the poorest in my university graduation ceremony. I might be bit materialist, but, man, I truly wish that for just once in my life, to feel that I’m equal in wealth to my peers. And now, I have nothing. That makes me feel like I’m nothing. -->"
