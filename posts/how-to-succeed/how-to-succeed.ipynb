    "Today I listened to [Naval's podcast](https://youtu.be/KyfUysrNaco?si=5bQq-YABQ7I59I6J) and [Twitter pinned message](https://x.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) and I got to say, it has one of the most interesting ideas. The idea of being \"unapoligetically selfish\" is the one that inspired me the most. Lately, I am becoming very unable to get the thing I wanted, find a way to a victory. Especially in football, I am certain that I can't seem to have cool-headedness. I feel like I'm a shame. But I have decided that, until I find success, I wouldn't quit this sport. I have quited it before, and I regret it now. Imagine who I would have been, if I didn't gave up so easily. "

I need to find and follow my passion for Julia, mathematics, (Python is cool but Julia is cooler) and football.\n",
