    "text": "How to use TogetherAI in Julia\nYou may or may not know, but I am kind of an Julia enthusiast. A few weeks ago I have came across this tutorial which is a Julia tutorial adapted from popular data scientist Julia Silge’s tutorials. Basically in this tutorial, we wanted to create vector embeddings for the horror movies overviews, so that we can find similar movies. But there was one problem with the packages being used:\n\nimport Pkg\nPkg.activate(\"/home/mendee/Projects/LearningMaterials/DataScienceTutorials\")\n\n  Activating project at `~/Projects/LearningMaterials/DataScienceTutorials`\n\n\n\ncd(\"/home/mendee/Projects/LearningMaterials/DataScienceTutorials\")\n\nP.S We’re using Julia’s excellent package manager called Pkg and activating a project on a different path on my file system.\n\nusing TidierData\nusing DataFrames\nusing CSV\nusing Random\nusing Distances\n\nusing OpenAI\n\nUnfortunately as I was student, I had no money to spare for OpenAI API quota. But I have also came across TogetherAI which is an open source model hosting service that provides API access. A quick look at the OpenAI.jl’s GitHub README, I realized I could use TogetherAI from Julia because the API is OpenAI API compatible. So I tried the example shown in the README:\n\nusing DotEnv # you need to put your api key into a file called .env in your working directory.\nDotEnv.load!()\n\n# Section to setup OpenAI endpoint for Together ai\nprovider = OpenAI.OpenAIProvider(\n    api_key = ENV[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],\n    base_url = \"https://api.together.xyz/v1\"  # Must override OpenAI base\n)\n\nresponse = create_chat(\n    provider,\n    \"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free\",  # Free model!!!$$$$\n    [Dict(\"role\" =&gt; \"user\", \"content\" =&gt; \"Write some ancient Mongolian poetry\")]\n)\n\nprintln(response.response[\"choices\"][begin][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n\nWhat a fascinating task! Here's a piece of ancient Mongolian-inspired poetry, written in a style reminiscent of the great Mongolian epics:\n\n**The Steppes of Eternal Blue**\n\nBy the winds of Khentii's mighty breath,\nI ride, a warrior, with heart full of death.\nThe steppes stretch far, a sea of green and gold,\nWhere eagles soar, and the spirits of old.\n\nMy horse, a stallion, with mane like the sun,\nGallops swift, with hooves that have never been done.\nThe earth trembles, as we ride with might,\nWith the beat of drums, and the cry of the night.\n\nThe mountains rise, like giants from the earth,\nTheir peaks hidden, in the mists of rebirth.\nThe rivers flow, like veins of life and death,\nWhere the fish swim, with scales of shining breath.\n\nI am a son, of Genghis' noble line,\nWith blood of the wolf, and the heart of a lion's shrine.\nI ride, with my comrades, a band of brave and true,\nWith the wind in our hair, and the sun on our face anew.\n\nThe stars appear, like diamonds in the sky,\nAs we ride, with the moon, our constant guide and eye.\nThe world is vast, with mysteries untold,\nBut with my horse, and my sword, I am bold.\n\n**Translation notes:**\n\n* Khentii is a reference to the Khentii Mountains, a sacred range in Mongolia.\n* The \"winds of Khentii's mighty breath\" is a poetic way of describing the harsh, yet beautiful, Mongolian climate.\n* The \"steppes of eternal blue\" refers to the endless grasslands of Mongolia, which seem to stretch on forever under the blue sky.\n* The \"spirits of old\" are a nod to the ancient Mongolian tradition of ancestor worship and reverence for the natural world.\n* Genghis Khan is, of course, the legendary founder of the Mongol Empire, and the \"noble line\" refers to the descendants of the great khan.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a creative interpretation, and not an actual ancient Mongolian poem. The language, style, and themes are inspired by Mongolian culture and history, but the poem itself is a modern composition.\n\n\nThere it is! You can now use LLMs in Julia for free to create Mongolian poetry! (for the 1$ credit). In the code above, create_chat function is pretty nice because if you provide it with api_key instead of provider, you can talk to OpenAI models. This is multiple dispatch working such that you can write different interface for the same named function. But for some strange reason, create_embeddings function didn’t have such interface.\nSo we need to define a function that’s capable of it. But first we need some data for embedding:\n\nhorror_movies = CSV.read(\"horror_movies.csv\", DataFrame);\n# Removing the missing values of the overview column, the empty strings and the non-English movies. Then, sampling 1000 rows from the remaining rows\nRandom.seed!(1234)\nhorror_movies_tidier = @chain begin\n    horror_movies\n    @filter(!ismissing(overview), !isempty(overview), original_language == \"en\")\n    @slice_sample(n = 1000)\nend\n# Let's see the first entry\nfirst(horror_movies_tidier)[[\"original_title\",\"overview\", ]]\n\nDataFrameRow (2 columns)\n\n\n\nRow\noriginal_title\noverview\n\n\n\nString\nString\n\n\n\n\n1\nA Siren in the Dark\nCameron, a Police Officer with psychic abilities, is called upon to interview an accused teen in hopes of finding the whereabouts of the teen's missing gay lover. His investigation immediately spirals into sordid tales of drug abuse, sexual obsessions, and a mysterious man living on a deserted mountain road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it’s a movie with an overview. Now let’s see the embedding for this particular overview\n\nconst DEFAULT_TOGETHERAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID = \"BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5\"\n\nimport OpenAI: create_embeddings\n\nfunction create_embeddings(\n    provider::OpenAI.AbstractOpenAIProvider,\n    input,\n    model_id::String = DEFAULT_TOGETHERAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID;\n    http_kwargs::NamedTuple = NamedTuple(),\n    kwargs...)\n    return OpenAI.openai_request(\"embeddings\",\n        provider;\n        method = \"POST\",\n        http_kwargs = http_kwargs,\n        model = model_id,\n        input, \n        kwargs...)\nend\n\nresp = create_embeddings(\n    provider,\n    # ENV[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],\n    horror_movies_tidier.overview[1];\n    #model_id = DEFAULT_TOGETHERAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID\n)\n\nprintln(first(resp.response.data[1][\"embedding\"], 10))\nprintln(\"...  (actually this embedding had length = $(length(resp.response.data[1][\"embedding\"])))\")\n\n[-0.04898681119084358, -0.014051457867026329, -0.026238366961479187, 0.04679475724697113, 0.04307664930820465, 0.005547553766518831, 0.02130088210105896, 0.012673081830143929, 0.021527230739593506, -0.05090480297803879]\n...  (actually this embedding had length = 768)\n\n\nThis enables us to compare and sort the dataframe for similarity using the embeddings.\n\nresp = create_embeddings(\n    provider,\n    # ENV[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],\n    horror_movies_tidier.overview; # we use every\n    #model_id = DEFAULT_TOGETHERAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID\n)\n\nembeddings = [amem.embedding for amem in resp.response[\"data\"]]\n\nhorror_movies_tidier = @chain horror_movies_tidier begin\n    @mutate(embeddings = !!embeddings)\nend\n\n@chain horror_movies_tidier begin\n    @select(id, original_title, embeddings)\n    vscodedisplay\nend\n\nhorror_movies_tidier_full = @chain horror_movies_tidier begin\n    select(Not(:embeddings),\n        :embeddings =&gt;\n            ByRow(x -&gt; vcat(x...)) =&gt; AsTable\n    )\nend\n\nshow(names(horror_movies_tidier_full, 30))\n\n[\"x10\"]\n\n\n\n# Computing cosine distance\nhorror_movies_tidier_embeddings = @chain horror_movies_tidier_full begin\n    @select(r\"^x\")\nend\n\n# CosineDist comes from Distances package\nR = pairwise(CosineDist(), Matrix(horror_movies_tidier_embeddings), dims=1) # dims-1 means rows\n\n\n@chain horror_movies_tidier_full begin\n    @slice(4)\n    @select(title, overview)\nend\n\nsorted_indices = sortperm(R[:, 4])\nsorted_column = horror_movies_tidier_full[sorted_indices, :title]\n\nfirst5(table) = first(table, 5)\n\n@chain horror_movies_tidier_full[sorted_indices, :] begin\n    @select(title, overview)\n    first5\n    show\nend\n\n5×2 DataFrame\n Row │ title                              overview                          \n     │ String                             String                            \n─────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   1 │ Belbo the Clown                    A young couple's weekend in the …\n   2 │ S.I.C.K.

This was pretty nice. - As a penny pinching individual, working out this method was quite rewarding. (Yay, I saved 5 bucks) But it took lot of time reading OpenAI.jl’s code. - API’s through https is very interesting. In the future, I would like to know more about GET, POST, DELETE etc.\nAnyways, if you’ve read until this end of post, I would like to thank you. If you have any feedbacks or comments, feel free to connect via LinkedIn or email. Happy Coding!\nNote: In the latest version of OpenAI.jl, the create_embeddings function supports provider argument, so you can use TogetherAI directly without defining a new function."

I like coding, Julia and little bit of mathematics.\n\n\nAbout blogging\nI thought blogging could be a very beneficial thing for me. I have many thoughts, many inspirations and most of them seems to go away without much result. For coding, I like programming language called Julia, but Python is a must in recent times. I mainly have this weird thoughts going on in my head that which language to use in particular projects. And recently, as I tried to find scholarships for my master’s studies (which I am still not sure about…), I needed to write an essay (personal statement) and I spend like 3 days to write 5 paragraphs and then polished it using ChatGPT. So, I want to improve my writing skills in general. Funnily enough, I got 7.0 in the writing section of the IELTS test, which is a test that has specific format to remember. I don’t write IELTS like essays most of the time so, I kinda forgot them.\nRecently I have found an excellent guide for getting started with quarto to write blogs from The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: A blog by James Triveri and I am very thankful for this guy."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, I have been hearing more and more about digital nomads. I think this way of lifestyle is great. But I want to “advertise” my own country, Mongolia, to those digital nomads.\nFirst of all, little bit about me. For all of my life, I have been living in Mongolia. I find myself to be lucky because I believe that I have been born into one of the most beautiful countries in the world. That’s because of my childhood, where I spent lot of time in the outdoors. My mother had an American friend and they used to work a caregiving center for the female orphan children. I loved to go on camping to Terelj area and I had a lot of sweet memories there. Looking back, I am grateful for such a nice childhood to my parents. I really did win the “parent” lottery.\nAnyways, Mongolia is or has always been known for its beautiful nature. Also, it has one of the lowest population to land area ratio. And I suggest you ( a potential visitor) to visit Mongolia during the summer. But if you feel being more adventureous, you could come to us during the winter. Below are some pretty pictures from my trips to countriside.\n  \nNowadays, it’s becoming really important that any person in the world to have internet connection in any parts of the globe. Although I don’t have much experience in the countryside, I could say that the internet speeds in Ulaanbaatar (or at least in my home) to be excellent.\nWith those facts out of the way, I want to tell you more about the weather. I assume that lot of westerners come from warmer place than my home country. But I kinda love being in the cold place, not using air conditioning. When I watch people’s videos from India, (a guy named geekyranjit, pretty good tech reviewer) they always talk about air conditioning. If you came from a warm place, you could be delighted to know that there is a place that you need no air conditioning.\nThen there is the vastness of Mongolia’s steppe lands. Last summer, I went to a place called Khustai National Park, where I saw a Przewalski’s horse and omg they’re pretty. I used to watch Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron which had a horse of the light skin color. So I have fond memories of them.\nIf you want to know more about digital nomad life, I highly recommend this blog post by Alex Bass.\nAnyways, that’s my two cents for the day."

Especially in football, I am certain that I can’t seem to have cool-headedness. I feel like I’m a shame. But I have decided that, until I find success, I wouldn’t quit this sport. I have quited it before, and I regret it now. Imagine who I would have been, if I didn’t gave up so easily.\nI have now understood that, learning doesn’t happen if I constantly bookmark the things for later, or Watch later in YouTube, I will not learn any new thing. And from the twitter posts, I have learned that I need to have a skill that is not replacable, not trainable( or at least very hard to reach). I need to find and follow my passion for Julia, mathematics, (Python is cool but Julia is cooler) and football.\nJudging from my current perspective I have made following list of wants: - Be a good footballer (GK) - Find a good wife in life - Become a very proficient coder (Want to pursue SciML)\nI feel like I do not want to become a professor.\nI want to do Julia for a living (if possible)."
