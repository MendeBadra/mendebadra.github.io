    "text": "I had this question a while ago, and I can’t seem to quite understand it in any kind of easy way. Let’s first start with Discrete Fourier Transform. It has something to do with Vandermonde matrix but I don’t quite get it. Why DFT is found that way? Namely: \\[\\hat{f}(x) = \\]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, I have been hearing more and more about digital nomads. I think this way of lifestyle is great. But I want to “advertise” my own country, Mongolia, to those digital nomads.\nFirst of all, little bit about me. For all of my life, I have been living in Mongolia. I find myself to be lucky because I believe that I have been born into one of the most beautiful countries in the world. That’s because of my childhood, where I spent lot of time in the outdoors. My mother had an American friend and they used to work a caregiving center for the female orphan children. I loved to go on camping to Terelj area and I had a lot of sweet memories there. Looking back, I am grateful for such a nice childhood to my parents. I really did win the “parent” lottery.\nAnyways, Mongolia is or has always been known for its beautiful nature. Also, it has one of the lowest population to land area ratio. And I suggest you ( a potential visitor) to visit Mongolia during the summer. But if you feel being more adventureous, you could come to us during the winter.\nNowadays, it’s becoming really important that any person in the world to have internet connection in any parts of the globe. Although I don’t have much experience in the countryside, I could say that the internet speeds in Ulaanbaatar (or at least in my home) to be excellent.\nWith those facts out of the way, I want to tell you more about the weather. I assume that lot of westerners come from warmer place than my home country. But I kinda love being in the cold place, not using air conditioning. When I watch people’s videos from India, (a guy named geekyranjit, pretty good tech reviewer) they always talk about air conditioning. If you came from a warm place, you could be delighted to know that there is a place that you need no air conditioning.\nThen there is the vastness of Mongolia’s steppe lands. Last summer, I went to a place called Khustai National Park, where I saw a Przewalski’s horse and omg they’re pretty. I used to watch Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron which had a horse of the light skin color. So I have fond memories of them.\nIf you want to know more about digital nomad life, I highly recommend this blog post by Alex Bass.\nAnyways, that’s my two cents for the day."

    "text": "About me\nMy name is Mend-Amar and I am from Mongolia. I like coding, Julia and little bit of mathematics.\n\n\nAbout blogging\nI thought blogging could be a very beneficial thing for me. I have many thoughts, many inspirations and most of them seems to go away without much result. For coding, I like programming language called Julia, but Python is a must in recent times. I mainly have this weird thoughts going on in my head that which language to use in particular projects. And recently, as I tried to find scholarships for my master’s studies (which I am still not sure about…), I needed to write an essay (personal statement) and I spend like 3 days to write 5 paragraphs and then polished it using ChatGPT. So, I want to improve my writing skills in general. Funnily enough, I got 7.0 in the writing section of the IELTS test, which is a test that has specific format to remember. I don’t write IELTS like essays most of the time so, I kinda forgot them.\nRecently I have found an excellent guide for getting started with quarto to write blogs from The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: A blog by James Triveri and I am very thankful for this guy."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I listened to Naval’s podcast and Twitter pinned message and I got to say, it has one of the most interesting ideas. The idea of being “unapoligetically selfish” is the one that inspired me the most. Lately, I am becoming very unable to get the thing I wanted, find a way to a victory. Especially in football, I am certain that I can’t seem to have cool-headedness. I feel like I’m a shame. But I have decided that, until I find success, I wouldn’t quit this sport. I have quited it before, and I regret it now. Imagine who I would have been, if I didn’t gave up so easily.\nI have now understood that, learning doesn’t happen if I constantly bookmark the things for later, or Watch later in YouTube, I will not learn any new thing. And from the twitter posts, I have learned that I need to have a skill that is not replacable, not trainable( or at least very hard to reach). I need to find and follow my passion for Julia, mathematics, (Python is cool but Julia is cooler) and football.\nJudging from my current perspective I have made following list of wants: - Be a good footballer (GK) - Find a good wife in life - Become a very proficient coder (Want to pursue SciML)\nI feel like I do not want to become a professor.\nI want to do Julia for a living (if possible)."
