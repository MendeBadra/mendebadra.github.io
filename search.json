    "text": "About me\nMy name is Mend-Amar and I am from Mongolia. I like coding, Julia and little bit of mathematics.\n\n\nAbout blogging\nI thought blogging could be a very beneficial thing for me. I have many thoughts, many inspirations and most of them seems to go away without much result. For coding, I like programming language called Julia, but Python is a must in recent times. I mainly have this weird thoughts going on in my head that which language to use in particular projects. And recently, as I tried to find scholarships for my master’s studies (which I am still not sure about…), I needed to write an essay (personal statement) and I spend like 3 days to write 5 paragraphs and then polished it using ChatGPT. So, I want to improve my writing skills in general. Funnily enough, I got 7.0 in the writing section of the IELTS test, which is a test that has specific format to remember. I don’t write IELTS like essays most of the time so, I kinda forgot them.\nRecently I have found an excellent guide for getting started with quarto to write blogs from The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: A blog by James Triveri and I am very thankful for this guy."

    "text": "Today I listened to Naval’s podcast and Twitter pinned message and I got to say, it has one of the most interesting ideas. The idea of being “unapoligetically selfish” is the one that inspired me the most. Lately, I am becoming very unable to get the thing I wanted, find a way to a victory. Especially in football, I am certain that I can’t seem to have cool-headedness. I feel like I’m a shame. But I have decided that, until I find success, I wouldn’t quit this sport. I have quited it before, and I regret it now. Imagine who I would have been, if I didn’t gave up so easily.\nI have now understood that, learning doesn’t happen if I constantly bookmark the things for later, or Watch later in YouTube, I will not learn any new thing. And from the twitter posts, I have learned that I need to have a skill that is not replacable, not trainable( or at least very hard to reach). I need to find and follow my passion for Julia, mathematics, (Python is cool but Julia is cooler) and football.\nJudging from my current perspective I have made following list of wants: - Be a good footballer (GK) - Find a good wife in life - Become a very proficient coder (Want to pursue SciML)\nI feel like I do not want to become a professor.\nI want to do Julia for a living (if possible)."
